# Snake Game on Nexys A7-100T FPGA development board

## Overview

This project implements the classic **Snake Game** using **Verilog**, deployed on the **Nexys A7-100T FPGA** development board.The game is rendered on a VGA display and controlled via push buttons.

The design implements digital systems, finite state machines (FSMs) and memory-based video output.

## Features

- Game physics and logic implemented entirely using Verilog.
- Snake's movement can be controlled using push buttons.
- Food generation and score counter is made using RNGs and counter.
- Collision detection (wall and self-hit) is implemented using FSMs.
- Game gets restart upon collision.
